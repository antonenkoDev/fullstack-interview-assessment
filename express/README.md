### 4. Add Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for task routes using Jest
- Test the priority field validation
- Test error handling middleware

## Success Criteria

1. Running `docker-compose up` successfully starts all services
2. Backend API endpoints are properly documented
3. Frontend can create and display tasks with priority
4. All unit tests pass
5. Proper error handling throughout the application
